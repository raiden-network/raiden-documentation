# Quick Start

## Overview

This tutorial will teach you how to:

* [Download the Raiden Wizard](./#download-the-raiden-wizard)
* [Setup and run a Raiden node](./#setup-and-run-a-raiden-node)

## Download the Raiden Wizard

You can download the Raiden Wizard for either macOS or Linux.

\*\*\*\*[**macOS download**](https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden-installer/releases/download/v0.32.0-testnet/raiden_wizard.macOS.zip)\*\*\*\*

\*\*\*\*[**Linux download**](https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden-installer/releases/download/v0.32.0-testnet/raiden_wizard.linux-gnu.bin.tar.gz)\*\*\*\*

## **Setup and run a Raiden node**

{% hint style="warning" %}
You need an internet connection to run the Raiden Wizard. The wizard will launch in your default browser.

The setup process can take up to five minutes, make sure not to close the browser.
{% endhint %}

1. Extract and open the **Raiden Wizard** file.
2. Insert your Infura project ID. Don't have a Infura project ID? Learn how to [get one here](./#get-an-infura-project-id).
3. Click **"Create New Configuration"** to configure, install and launch the latest version of Raiden.

## Relaunch Raiden

When opening the **Raiden Wizard** file, you will find two ways of relaunching Raiden.

1. Click the **"Launch"** button next to a configuration you already created.
2. Repeat the steps from ["Setup and Run a Raiden Node"](./#setup-and-run-a-raiden-node) to create a new configuration.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Each new configuration created will be added to the list and currently you can't delete configurations from the Wizard. Read more under ["Handle Limitations"](known-issues.md).
{% endhint %}

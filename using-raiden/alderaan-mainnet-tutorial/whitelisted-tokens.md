# Whitelisted Tokens

The Raiden Alderaan release is a bug bounty release which puts a certain limit on the amount of tokens that can be deposited into a channel. This is to minimize potential loss of funds in case of bugs.

* The global limit per token network is **$1000000**.
* The limit per channel side is **$1000**.

## W-ETH

W-ETH stands for _Wrapped Ether_ and is essentially Ehter that has been packaged to become ERC-20 compatible.

There are several ways in which you can create W-ETH from your Ether.

* Using the [0x Portal](https://0x.org/portal/account) interface
* Using the [Radar Relay](https://radarrelay.com/) interface
* Using the [contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2956356cd2a2bf3202f771f50d3d14a367b48070#code) directly

## DAI

DAI is a popular stablecoin. Visit [Maker DAO](https://makerdao.com/en/) for further information on how to purchase it.
